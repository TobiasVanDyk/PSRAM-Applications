# PSRAM-Applications
A number of 64Mb (8MB) [**AP Memory Technology APS6404L-3SQN QSPI PSRAM**](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/AP-Memory/APS6404L-3SQN-SN?qs=IS%252B4QmGtzzqCot9%252BeIJwKw%3D%3D) had been obtained from [**Mouser (Texas)**](https://www.mouser.com/), and are being tested through their single and quad SPI memory interface modes, for the latter using the RP2040 Pico (for which there is potential r/w QSPI support), and the established QSPI support for the Teensy 4.1 and ESP32's.
